# PTSScan Quick Guide

## Basic Commands

# Scan a single file
ptsscan -i contract.sol

# Recursive directory scan
ptsscan -i ./contracts -r

## Generate Reports (Now with Line Numbers & Code Snippets!)

# JSON report (includes line_number and code_snippet for each bug)
ptsscan -i ./contracts -r -o results.json

# Excel report (includes Line and Code Snippet columns)
ptsscan -i ./contracts -r -o results.xlsx -f excel

# Both formats
ptsscan -i ./contracts -r -o results -f both

## Filter and Exclude

# Filter by severity
ptsscan -i ./contracts -r --severity critical high

# Filter by category
ptsscan -i ./contracts -r --categories access_control reentrancy

# Exclude test files

## New Features ✨

### Automatic Line Number Extraction
- PTSScan now automatically extracts line numbers from violation messages
- No need to modify any rules!

### Code Snippets
- Shows 2 lines before and after the problematic line
- Marks the exact line with >>> 
- Example:
       1 | // Bad: No access control
       2 | contract BadContract {
  >>>  3 |     function withdrawAll() public {
       4 |         // dangerous
       5 |     }

### Enhanced Reports
- JSON: Includes "line_number" and "code_snippet" fields
- Excel: New "Line" and "Code Snippet" columns
- Professional output matching industry tools

## Tips

1. Use `-r` for recursive scanning
2. Use `--severity critical high` to focus on important issues
3. Use `-v` for detailed output during scanning
4. Use `--exclude` to skip test files
5. Use `-f both` to get both JSON and Excel reports
6. Check the "Line" column in Excel for quick navigation
7. Review "Code Snippet" column to understand context
